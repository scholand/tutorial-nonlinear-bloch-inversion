## Tutorial: Quantitative MRI by Nonlinear Inversion of the Bloch Equations

**Title**: Quantitative MRI by Nonlinear Inversion of the Bloch Equations  
**Meeting**: Workshop on "Quantitative Multi-parametric MRI as an Inversion Problem"  
**Date**: November 27, 2024  

This folder contains a standalone demo, which introduces the simulation, digital reference object, and synthetic MRI interface in BART. The final section contain a demonstration of how to run model-based reconstruction with Bloch simulations as forward models to perform this nonlinear inversion of the Bloch equations. This tutorial contains much documentation on the command line interface of the individual tools and references to even more detailed resources. The tutorial is set up as jupyter notebook and can interactively be tested using Google Colaboratory.
